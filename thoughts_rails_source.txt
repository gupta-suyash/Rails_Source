- 	The Rails source code contains several parts, among which folder of our interest is activerecord. 
- 	The base file activerecord.rb is sort of wrapper that loads all the pertaining classes and modules.
	It makes use of require and autoload. 
	Require is like "import" in C or Java, while autoload can be termed as a lazy version of require that loads a class only when needed !
-	Our current target is to find the relevant implementations for the CRUD methods (Create, Read, Update and Delete).
	The CRUD methods are used by active-record and are passed to its sub-classes for accessing data.

-	The rails subfolder consists of a ruby file that helps to generate rails migrations and models (thats my guess as per now).
-	There are some templates inside these folders which I believe may be some example implementation.
-	In the file "active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/database_statements.rb" we have some information about the isolation levels. 
	My current understanding suggests that the support for 4 transaction isolation levels has been provided, i.e. 
	read_uncommitted, read_committed, repeatable_read and serializable.
-	This file also has methods for "starting a transaction" at an appropriate isolation level --> def begin_isolated_db_transaction(isolation).
	Other methods include, "starting a transaction", "committing a transaction", "rollbacking a transaction" and so on.
-	For PostGRE, Sqlite and Mysql there are different connection adapters, such as sqlite3_adapter.rb present in active_record/connection_adapters. 
	All the adapters extend the base class abstract_adapter, found in the same directory. 
	Each adapter has an execute method which runs an SQL query. 
	These methods are passed an sql query to run, while the specific implementation of the query or how it is run on the database is 
	currently not clear, but what we can see in these execute() methods is that a connection (using variable @connection) 
	to the database is made.

-	Arel is our key to accessing the SQL queries !
	It is a building block used by other frameworks such as ActiveRecord (the ORM in Rails).
	AR uses Arel to build the queries and executing it.
	Arel builds a query using the notion of an AST.
	ActiveRecord's query interface is built on top of Arel.

-	We need to try modify the sqlite3 adapter to check whether it can accept our instructions.
	This will allow us to manipulate the query as per our needs.

-	After building the rails from the source code, we are using my-test-app to test our application.
	To check our changes in the rails code we need to create a sample application and modify our code 
	as per our needs.

-	TO make use of RubyMine for editing the rails source code, we need to unlock the files which requires changing the access modes 
	for the file.
	Use command chmod go+w to provide write permission to the file.
	The location where the ruby-on-rails source files are present on Mac are: 
	/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/activerecord-4.0.8/lib/
